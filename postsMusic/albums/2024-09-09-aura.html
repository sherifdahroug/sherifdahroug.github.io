            <p>Dedicated to: Sha-Amun-en-su, Priestess and Hymn Singer in the Temple of Amun, Thebes (8th century BCE)

                ---
                
                Section I: Artistic Approach and Compositional Philosophy
                
                "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" is a work that seeks to intertwine the past and the present through a sophisticated, evocative musical narrative. It follows the lineage of Camille Saint-Saëns and his vocation to enrich his compositions with Orientalism—a tradition deeply rooted in French music history, tracing back to Napoleon's expedition to Egypt with Félicien David and continuing through to Debussy. My approach is to extend this tradition by embracing both tonal-bimodal writing and a variation on an ancient Egyptian theme. This theme can be traced back to the quasi-sacred, profane chants of Amun, intricately woven into a musical structure that juxtaposes modal sacred chants with romantic tonal richness. 
                
                The piece strategically dissolves the omnipresent pedal point nature of modal sacred chants and integrates them into a framework of romantic tonal harmony. The intention is to craft a dramatic effect that solidifies the expressiveness of modal melodies with the harmonic depth of Western classical music, ultimately creating a work that embodies a rich cross-cultural dialogue. By doing so, "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" challenges traditional forms and offers an innovative exploration of blending ancient musical motifs with contemporary harmonic language.
                
                This work is a tonal exploration of how music can serve as a bridge between cultures, eras, and spiritual dimensions. The composition does not merely adopt a historical theme; rather, it transforms it into a living, breathing entity that speaks to the human condition, the search for meaning, and the eternal dance between light and darkness.
                
                Section II: Thematic Philosophy and Dedication
                
                Title Meaning and Dedication:
                
                "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" translates to "An Aura in the Darkness," symbolizing a spiritual light guiding us through the obscurities of existence. The work is dedicated to the spirit of Sha-Amun-en-su, an ancient Egyptian priestess and hymn singer whose rituals once filled the Temple of Karnak with divine resonance. In 2018, her physical remains were lost in the tragic fire of the Rio de Janeiro Museum, but her spirit and the music she performed for the gods endure eternally.
                
                This dedication is not only a tribute but a philosophical meditation on memory, loss, and the eternal quest for spiritual reunion. The work seeks to convey a narrative of longing and eternal love, guided by the myth of Sha-Amun-en-su and her beloved, Neb-nefer, a master shipbuilder who never returned from a perilous journey at sea.
                
                Mythological and Philosophical Inspirations:
                
                The thematic core of "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" is inspired by the myth of Sha-Amun-en-su, whose love for Neb-nefer defies time and space. Their love story, echoing through the ages under the last remaining sycamore tree on the eastern bank of the Nile, serves as the foundational narrative for the composition. The sycamore tree, a sacred symbol in Egyptian mythology, becomes the central motif—a place where the heavens meet the earth, and where love, loss, and longing converge.
                
                The work raises profound questions about memory, loss, and the quest for eternity. The relationship between Sha-Amun-en-su and Neb-nefer is not just a story of personal love but a symbolic representation of an eternal bond that transcends mortality. This tragic love is reminiscent of myths where hope and sorrow intertwine, and where art becomes a language that preserves memory and binds souls across time.
                
                In this composition, the sacred music "illuminates the darkness," serving as a spiritual beacon in moments of confusion and loss. It is an acknowledgment of the continuity of human emotions, asserting that love and memory can defy time and remain forever.
                
                Section III: Structural and Technical Considerations
                
                Compositional Technique: Tonal-Bimodal Writing
                
                The structure of "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" is built on a dual compositional technique: tonal-bimodal writing and thematic variations on ancient Egyptian musical elements. The bimodal writing offers a duality—one that reflects the contrasts between sacred and profane, ancient and modern, Eastern and Western. The structure deliberately evolves from the modal chants associated with sacred rituals of Amun toward a more romantic, tonally rich expression that seeks to solidify the emotional resonance of these modal melodies.
                
                Use of Pedal Point and Modal Dissolution:
                
                In a deliberate compositional choice, the work utilizes and gradually dissolves the pedal point—a characteristic of ancient modal music. This dissolution allows the modal melodies to interact dynamically with the tonal harmony, creating a dramatic tension that elevates the narrative to new heights. The harmonic language is both expansive and restrained, enabling a dialogue between the modal sacred chants and the romantic expressiveness of Western tonality.
                
                Architectonic Motifs and Musical Moods:
                
                The composition is structured around architectonic cells and motifs that serve as thematic anchors throughout the work. Each motif is carefully constructed to evoke specific moods—ranging from ethereal and divine to deeply melancholic and introspective. These motifs are not static; they evolve, intertwine, and transform throughout the piece, mirroring the narrative’s journey from hope to despair and ultimately to a transcendent understanding of love and loss.
                
                Musical Moods and Their Emotional Resonance:
                
                The mood of the music is shaped by its rich harmonic palette and melodic lines that explore the depths of human emotion. From the serene and sacred to the turbulent and dramatic, each section of the work unfolds as a chapter in a larger narrative that is both universal and deeply personal. The interplay between the sacred and the profane, the tonal and the modal, creates an emotional landscape that invites listeners to reflect on their own experiences of love, loss, and spiritual longing.
                
                Conclusion
                
                "Une Aura dans les Ténèbres" is more than a composition; it is an artistic and philosophical statement that seeks to bridge the ancient and the modern, the sacred and the secular. Through its innovative use of tonal-bimodal writing, thematic dedication to a lost priestess, and a narrative that resonates with universal themes of love, loss, and eternity, this work aspires to honor the lineage of Saint-Saëns and the rich tradition of French composers who have been inspired by the Orient. It is a composition that embodies the very essence of cross-cultural dialogue and aims to leave a lasting impact on both the listeners and the cultural fabric of contemporary music.
