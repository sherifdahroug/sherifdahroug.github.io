            <p>From the times that preceded the written history, when the Egyptian spirit traveled through the folds of time, the ancient Egyptian, with his eternal wisdom, understood that the fate of the universe is measured with precision on a scale that only tilts with balance. In this profound and complex universe, the Egyptian recognized that balance is the essence of harmony, the force that ensures the continuation of the cosmic order. Life, as understood by the ancients, is not an eternal struggle but a state of integration and harmony between opposing forces, each complementing the other in an eternal cycle that preserves the continuity and beauty of the cosmos.
                On one side of this scale stands the god Osiris, Lord of the Southern Sky, master of resurrection and renewal, symbol of life and death, sunrise and sunset. Osiris ensures that every end brings a new beginning and that the cycle of life continues uninterrupted. His power lies in his ability to restore life to what has ended, to bring light to what has sunk into darkness. Osiris reorganizes the universe after every chaos, ensuring the return of the seasons and the rebirth of the sun after each sunset.
                On the other side stands the god Set, Lord of the Northern Sky, the eternal constant who knows no decay. Set is not merely a symbol of chaos but the hero who overcomes it. He is the force that ensures the stability of the cosmos, maintaining the balance necessary for the continuation of life. While Osiris symbolizes the renewing cycle of life, Set represents the power that supports and protects this renewal, restoring balance after every disturbance.
                The worship of the god Set dates back to the early periods of ancient Egyptian history, with his main cult center located in the city of Ombos, known today as Naqada, in Upper Egypt. As the god of the Northern Sky, Set was associated with the stars that never set, a symbol of his eternal nature. In Egyptian cosmology, Set was linked to the North Star, "Khebs," considered the unwavering guide in the night.
                Set also played a crucial role in the "Opening of the Mouth" ritual, believed to restore the senses to the deceased, enabling them to eat, speak, and breathe in the afterlife. This ritual symbolized the revival of life, with Set, as the giver of life, being central to this process. Through this ritual, Set was invoked to guide the soul through the dangers of the afterworld, ensuring its arrival in the realm of Osiris, where it would be reborn. The circumpolar stars, under Set's protection, were seen as the eternal destination of the soul's journey, guiding it peacefully through the celestial realms.
                Thus, if Osiris is the guarantor of the afterlife, Set is its originator. The ancient Egyptians believed that the soul, like the stars in the Northern Sky, would never perish but would be renewed by Set's eternal power. This belief is beautifully expressed in ancient texts:  
                "For his sake (i.e., Osiris) the Two Enneads (i.e., the nine gods in each) are purified in the Imperishable Stars."
                Here, the "Two Enneads" refer to stellar constellations, each consisting of nine stars, believed to be reborn in the Southern Sky, like the deceased who would follow the path of the circumpolar stars under Set's guidance to be reborn and join Osiris in a life that renews itself endlessly, just like the seasons and ages.
                The title Nocturnal, Leopard Guide suggests a multifaceted exploration of nocturnal life, where a panther, symbolizing the Egyptian god Set, leads the way through the darkness. This nocturnal guide can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically, offering insights into nocturnal behavior and navigating the unknown. Set, the ancient god associated with power and protection, is portrayed here in the form of the black panther, embodying strength, mystery, and steadfastness in the face of chaos.
                In Egyptian wisdom, Set defeats the chaotic serpent Apophis every night on behalf of the sun god Ra, ensuring that the sun is reborn each day. This image makes Set a symbol of the force that maintains the balance of the cosmos against any threat. In this album, listeners are guided through the nocturnal realms by the black panther, Set, where darkness becomes a source of wisdom. But in this musical journey, Set takes us on another journey, one of transformations.
                The Egyptian concept of transformations as an intellectual construct is considered a gradual, ascending movement towards the source of ideas. This concept may have inspired the idea of the dialectical ascent of ideas (Dialectique). This dialectical ascent of ideas is a cumulative process that evolves from its sensory aspect to a rising movement that transforms into an algebraic equation, satisfying in itself the hunger for reaching a state of symbolism. 
                The progression of ideas ascends until it reaches a level of abstraction that can be expressed using an "algebraic equation," a metaphorical expression indicating that ideas have become complex and precisely defined. This satisfies the inherent desire to achieve a state of symbolism. Ultimately, these ideas transform into symbols, where these symbols are capable of representing complex ideas in an intense and comprehensive manner.
                This is what can be called dialectical transformations, representing the journey of the black panther, Set, who leads us on an ascending path towards wisdom and harmony.
                In this journey, Set's role as a guide through the darkness is manifested, not only to overcome chaos but to transform this chaos into order, and to turn ideas into symbols and algebraic equations representing the essence of the universe. This transformation is an integral part of the ancient Egyptian experience, where it is not just about conflict or stability, but about the ability to transform every element in the universe into a part of a complete whole.
                *Nocturnal, Leopard Guide* is a musical reflection of this deep harmony between Osiris and Set, between renewal and protection. This album takes us on a journey through the night, where we realize that darkness and light, chaos and order, are not opposites but complements, and that the continuity of the universe depends on this sacred balance between forces.
                This artistic work embodies the spirit of ancient Egyptian wisdom, inviting us to contemplate how the great forces of the universe collaborate to maintain its balance. In this musical journey, we discover that life and death, light and darkness, are parts of an eternal cycle that requires balance and integration, not conflict or confrontation.
                The work is organized as a single image, divided into three moments, each representing a different aspect of the nocturnal journey under Set's guidance:
                1. Toward the Infinite Darkness: This opening moment represents the transition from day to night. The music begins with a calm and fading light, gradually becoming more mysterious and intense as darkness falls. This moment captures the anticipation and subtle changes that occur as the world prepares for night.
                2. Secrets of the Night: The second moment delves into the heart of the night, exploring its mysterious and enigmatic aspects. Under Set's guidance, the music navigates through hidden wonders and secrets concealed by the darkness. This segment captures the essence of the nocturnal world, filled with unknown and magical elements.
                3.Transformation and Dawn: The final moment marks the end of the journey, where night transforms into day. This segment symbolizes transformation and new beginnings, as the music captures the first light of dawn and the rebirth of the world.
                The work speaks to the gradual and complex evolution of ideas from an initial, sensory state to an abstract and symbolic state, likened to a dialectical ascent. The journey ends with an "algebraic equation" that holds within it the secret of the universe.
