        </div>
        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
      </div>      

    <div class="two-columns">
      <p>
        Sherif Dahroug is an internationally acclaimed composer and concert artist whose visionary work marks a major advancement in contemporary music. Originally trained as a naval architect, he earned a Master’s degree in Naval Architecture and Hydrodynamics with honors before fully dedicating himself to the pursuit of art and music. This remarkable journey reflects his relentless quest for excellence, swiftly establishing him as a prominent figure on the international music scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        A recipient of numerous prestigious accolades and major awards, Sherif Dahroug has been honored with the Diamond Prize for Composition at the Classical Music Awards in London and the Grand Prize of the New York International Music Competition. Among his many distinctions are Platinum Absolute First Prizes at the World Master Open, as well as multiple Gold and Silver honors from esteemed competitions across Europe, Russia, and the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2025, he was awarded the Absolute First Platinum Prize at the European Symphony Architect Awards for his opus and album Dichotomie. Further recognizing his artistic influence, the jury named him "Artist of the Month" at the European Classical Music Awards. These same awards later declared him the Annual Diamond Prize Winner and bestowed upon him the distinguished title of "Composer of the Year" at the 2024 Annual Grand Prix.
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class="highlight-grammy">
        In 2025, Sherif Dahroug was invited to join the Recording Academy / GRAMMYs® as a <strong>Voting Member</strong>, honoring his artistic vision and global impact on contemporary music.
      </div>

      <br>
      

      <p>
        His album <em>Regards sur l’Horizon</em>, honored by the Global Music Awards, has already established itself as a landmark in contemporary musical creation. His academic journey, shaped by studies at the Schola Cantorum, the École Normale de Musique de Paris, and the Royal Academy of Music in London, placed him under the tutelage of eminent mentors—heirs to the legendary traditions of Sergiu Celibidache, Nadia Boulanger, and Olivier Messiaen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Decorated with the highest honors and degrees, he embodies a refined musicianship where rigor and creative freedom intertwine. Beyond music, Sherif Dahroug is a philosopher and author whose literary work expands the boundaries of artistic creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        His latest book, <em>Dichotomie: Grand Hymne des Deux Terres</em>, stands as a bold and singular masterpiece, fusing poetry, philosophy, and mysticism to offer a uniquely immersive experience. More than just an exploration of ancient Egyptian thought, this work revives it through an incantatory language, a labyrinthine structure, and a contemplative aesthetic, elevating duality as a foundational principle of both art and existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        His earlier book, <em>In Pursuit of a Sonic Architectonics</em>, serves as a bold manifesto that transcends traditional boundaries of creation. Drawing from the rich symbolism and philosophy of ancient Egypt, it bridges transcendental contemplation with technical realization, transforming contradictions and dissonances into spaces of unprecedented beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        An insatiable explorer of the correspondences between sound, space, and transcendence, Sherif Dahroug pursues a vision where each creation becomes a timeless sonic architecture, a sanctuary open to infinity.

                <h3>Heritage and Excellence</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">

In the arts, this recognition is regarded as an acknowledgment of excellence comparable to the highest academic achievements. This honor underscores Dahroug's exceptional virtuosity and artistic mastery, cultivated under the guidance of Maestros Pascal Boels (interpretation), Jean-Pierre Wallez (chamber music and conducting), and Narcis Bonet and Michel Denis (composition, analysis, orchestral conducting).
                    In 2017, he earned the The Diplôme de Virtuosité, equivalent to a post-Master of Arts (HEM), represents the pinnacle of advanced musical training, crowning an extensive education and remarkable artistic accomplishment.

In 2009, after completing advanced diplomas in performance and composition at the London Royal Academy of Music, he moved to Paris with a scholarship from the École Normale de Musique. Between 2009 and 2015, he refined his craft under the tutelage of Maestros François Martin and Tania Chagnot, earning the Brevet d’Exécution and the Diplôme d’Exécution.
                    His musical exploration also includes a robust theoretical foundation. In 2014, he achieved the Diplôme d’Harmonie et d’Analyse Musicale under the mentorship of Maestros Narcis Bonet and Jean-Dominique Pasquet, organist of the Oratoire du Louvre. In 2011, he completed a Diplôme d’Histoire under the supervision of Frank Torres, deepening his understanding of the roots and evolution of musical art.
                    These accolades, earned at emblematic institutions and under the guidance of exceptional masters, attest to a rare synthesis of technical virtuosity, interpretative depth, and intellectual rigor.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Originally from Alexandria, Egypt, Sherif Dahroug began his formal musical training at the Alexandria Conservatory of Music, where he not only honed his craft but also held a teaching position. Under the mentorship of the distinguished Egyptian composer Ramz Sabry Samy, he deepened his studies in harmony and composition, refining his musical voice within the rich artistic landscape of his hometown.

                <h3>Art as a Quest</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond performance and composition, Sherif Dahroug embraces a vision where music intertwines with philosophy, visual arts, architecture, and even astronomy. This fascination with interdisciplinary connections reflects a profound artistic quest that fosters boundless creativity. By transcending the boundaries of traditional genres, Dahroug explores uncharted musical perspectives, crafting a language that speaks to the soul as much as to the intellect.

Each composition becomes a bridge between disciplines, demonstrating a remarkable ability to reinvent styles and forms. Among his recent works (2023–2024), pieces such as Philae, Hiérakonpolis, Abydos, ATUM, and Eirene – Old Comedy! exemplify his versatility and commitment to capturing the essence of art as an eternal quest.
                    These compositions, imbued with meticulous reflection, reveal a mastery of technique and artistic sensitivity that pushes the conventional boundaries of contemporary music. Far from being mere pieces, they transform into immersive experiences, inviting profound contemplation of the interconnectedness between disciplines, humanity, and the cosmos.

            <div class="two-columns" style="column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">  
                <h3>From Oceans to Music</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Sherif Dahroug, a trained naval architect, holds a Master’s degree in Naval Hydrodynamics, awarded with honors in 2006. He also carries the prestigious title of GMRINA from the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. His career includes work as a maritime expert at the esteemed Hellenic classification society and an academic position teaching naval design in specialized studio courses.
                  His path in naval architecture was more than a profession—it was a calling shaped by both lineage and environment. Born into a family where the sea was not just a livelihood but a legacy, he grew up immersed in the world of maritime expertise. His father, an eminent figure in the Egyptian naval forces, exposed him from an early age to the intricate realities of shipbuilding, hydrodynamics, and the discipline of naval engineering.

                  Yet, his upbringing was equally steeped in a rich intellectual and artistic tradition. His family possessed an immense bibliotheca, a treasure trove of universal literature that spanned Russian novelists, French poets, British classics, and the profound intellectual traditions of Egypt. This vast literary heritage nurtured a mind attuned to both the precision of science and the boundless realm of artistic expression. It was within this dual inheritance—technical mastery and poetic introspection—that he found a rare equilibrium, shaping his worldview and, ultimately, his creative identity.
                  
                  Though his career began in naval architecture, the echoes of music, literature, and philosophy remained ever-present, guiding him toward his true passion: composition. In his music, one can sense the meticulous structure of an engineer intertwined with the expressive depth of a poet—a synthesis of two worlds seamlessly woven into sound.

                <h3>Ancient Egypt as a Source of Awakening</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Deeply inspired by ancient Egypt, Sherif Dahroug delves into its astronomy, philosophy, and hieroglyphic writing with unbounded curiosity. This personal journey has led him to author scientific articles that shed light on the profound influence of astronomical knowledge on Egyptian philosophical thought.
                    In 2016, he founded his blog, Meditations on Egyptian Wisdom, which has since cultivated a dedicated community drawn to his unique perspective. Drawing from the astronomy, history, and philosophy of this remarkable civilization, Dahroug infuses his musical creations with a timeless and universal dimension.

                <h3>A Pen in Search of Architectonics</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Sherif Dahroug, already celebrated for his musical and artistic achievements, unveils a new dimension of his talent with the release of his rare and groundbreaking book, In Search of a Sonic Architectonic. The fruit of eight years of meticulous research and profound reflection, this work invites readers on an introspective journey. Through writing that combines depth and poetry, Dahroug explores the subtle connections between architecture, astronomy, philosophy, and music, weaving a universal vision where thought becomes vibration, and music transforms into a timeless structure.
                    Inspired by the wisdom of ancient Egypt and grounded in a contemporary perspective, this first volume embarks on a bold quest: to unveil universal beauty and eternity. Addressing the challenges of modern humanity, Dahroug envisions a harmonious future where science and creativity dance in symbiosis, offering a unique perspective on sonic architectonics.
                    The book also features an exceptional musical work, Regards sur l’Horizon – Opus Magistralis, composed of twenty movements. Spanning over two hours, this monumental piece constructs an initiatory journey through the sacred sites of ancient Egypt, connecting these places of memory with sonic resonances that reveal their philosophical essence.
                    Richly illustrated by the author, this masterpiece fuses thought and art, sound and image. The original illustrations embody a poetic vision, transforming architectural forms into sensory gateways and inviting readers into an immersive and unparalleled experience.
