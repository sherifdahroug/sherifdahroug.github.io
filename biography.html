            <h1>ABOUT THE ARTIST</h1>
            <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sherif Dahroug, globally celebrated composer and concert artist, is making groundbreaking strides within the international community of accomplished musicians. Originally trained as a naval architect, he earned a Master’s degree in Naval Architecture and Hydrodynamics with honors before dedicating his life to the pursuit of arts and music on the global stage. This remarkable transition reflects his profound commitment to artistic excellence, swiftly establishing him as a visionary in the world of music. Today, he is widely celebrated as a leading figure on the international music scene.
                A recipient of numerous prestigious accolades and major awards, Sherif Dahroug has been honored with the Diamond Prize for Composition at the Classical Music Awards in London and the Grand Prize of the New York International Music Competition. Among his many distinctions are Platinum Absolute First Prizes at the World Master Open and the European Classical Music Awards, as well as multiple Gold and Silver honors from esteemed competitions across Europe, Russia, and the United States. These achievements underscore his unparalleled mastery in performance and composition, solidifying his place among the most accomplished artists of his generation. Dahroug’s illustrious career stands as a testament to his exceptional artistic brilliance. His album Regards sur l’Horizon, awarded the Global Music Awards for composition, stands as a seal of his outstanding achievement, further cementing his reputation as a groundbreaking artist in the field. His education at renowned institutions such as the Schola Cantorum, the École Normale de Musique de Paris, and the Royal Academy of Music in London refined his craft under the tutelage of eminent mentors—heirs to the legendary traditions of Sergiu Celibidache, Nadia Boulanger, and Olivier Messiaen—earning him the highest honors and degrees.
                Beyond his celebrated career as a musician, Sherif Dahroug is also a philosopher-author. His book, In Pursuit of a Sonic Architectonics, serves as a bold manifesto that transcends traditional boundaries of creation. Drawing from the rich symbolism and philosophy of ancient Egypt, it bridges transcendental contemplation with technical realization, transforming contradictions and dissonances into spaces of unprecedented beauty.
                Unbound by convention, Dahroug elevates the enigma of sonic art, proposing a timeless aesthetic rooted in a vision of universal renewal. Through his work, he invites audiences to rethink the foundations of art, offering a boundless realm where every creation becomes an infinite journey of discovery.

            <div class="two-columns" style="column-count: 1; column-gap: 20px;">  
                <h3>From Oceans to Music</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Sherif Dahroug, a trained naval architect, holds a Master’s degree in Naval Hydrodynamics, awarded with honors in 2006. He also carries the prestigious title of GMRINA from the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. His career includes work as a maritime expert at the esteemed Hellenic classification society and an academic position teaching naval design in specialized studio courses.
                  His path in naval architecture was more than a profession—it was a calling shaped by both lineage and environment. Born into a family where the sea was not just a livelihood but a legacy, he grew up immersed in the world of maritime expertise. His father, an eminent figure in the Egyptian naval forces, exposed him from an early age to the intricate realities of shipbuilding, hydrodynamics, and the discipline of naval engineering.

                  Yet, his upbringing was equally steeped in a rich intellectual and artistic tradition. His family possessed an immense bibliotheca, a treasure trove of universal literature that spanned Russian novelists, French poets, British classics, and the profound intellectual traditions of Egypt. This vast literary heritage nurtured a mind attuned to both the precision of science and the boundless realm of artistic expression. It was within this dual inheritance—technical mastery and poetic introspection—that he found a rare equilibrium, shaping his worldview and, ultimately, his creative identity.
                  
                  Though his career began in naval architecture, the echoes of music, literature, and philosophy remained ever-present, guiding him toward his true passion: composition. In his music, one can sense the meticulous structure of an engineer intertwined with the expressive depth of a poet—a synthesis of two worlds seamlessly woven into sound.

                <h3>Ancient Egypt as a Source of Awakening</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Deeply inspired by ancient Egypt, Sherif Dahroug delves into its astronomy, philosophy, and hieroglyphic writing with unbounded curiosity. This personal journey has led him to author scientific articles that shed light on the profound influence of astronomical knowledge on Egyptian philosophical thought.
                    In 2016, he founded his blog, Meditations on Egyptian Wisdom, which has since cultivated a dedicated community drawn to his unique perspective. Drawing from the astronomy, history, and philosophy of this remarkable civilization, Dahroug infuses his musical creations with a timeless and universal dimension.

                <h3>A Pen in Search of Architectonics</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Sherif Dahroug, already celebrated for his musical and artistic achievements, unveils a new dimension of his talent with the release of his rare and groundbreaking book, In Search of a Sonic Architectonic. The fruit of eight years of meticulous research and profound reflection, this work invites readers on an introspective journey. Through writing that combines depth and poetry, Dahroug explores the subtle connections between architecture, astronomy, philosophy, and music, weaving a universal vision where thought becomes vibration, and music transforms into a timeless structure.
                    Inspired by the wisdom of ancient Egypt and grounded in a contemporary perspective, this first volume embarks on a bold quest: to unveil universal beauty and eternity. Addressing the challenges of modern humanity, Dahroug envisions a harmonious future where science and creativity dance in symbiosis, offering a unique perspective on sonic architectonics.
                    The book also features an exceptional musical work, Regards sur l’Horizon – Opus Magistralis, composed of twenty movements. Spanning over two hours, this monumental piece constructs an initiatory journey through the sacred sites of ancient Egypt, connecting these places of memory with sonic resonances that reveal their philosophical essence.
                    Richly illustrated by the author, this masterpiece fuses thought and art, sound and image. The original illustrations embody a poetic vision, transforming architectural forms into sensory gateways and inviting readers into an immersive and unparalleled experience.
