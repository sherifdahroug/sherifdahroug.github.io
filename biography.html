            <p>Sherif Dahroug is an internationally awarded composer, recording artist, and concert master, distinguished by a dual artistic identity that encompasses both compositional creation and an exceptionally rare bi-instrumental virtuosity on classical guitar and piano. His intellectual formation is marked by its unfolding within the domain of engineering: he earned, with honors, a Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Hydrodynamics before electing to devote himself entirely to musical art. This passage from scientific rigor toward artistic vocation reflects a continuity of method and aspiration, grounded in precision, structure, and an uncompromising pursuit of excellence.</p>
  
            <p>His musical language reflects this synthesis. Virtuosic command is inseparable from architectural coherence; expressive depth is supported by carefully articulated formal design. The result is an oeuvre characterized by structural clarity, timbral refinement, and conceptual unity, through which he has established a singular and recognizable artistic voice. Through these qualities, Sherif Dahroug has emerged as a salient figure on the international musical scene, whose work resonates with both intellectual discipline and poetic resonance.</p>
  
            <p>A recipient of more than 44 prestigious international awards, Sherif Dahroug has been distinguished across leading cultural capitals, including Vienna, London, Paris, New York, California, and Moscow, as well as Athens, Amsterdam, Berlin, Lugano, and Birmingham. His honors include the Diamond Prize for Composition at the Classical Music Awards in London and the Grand Prize of the New York International Music Competition, alongside Platinum Absolute First Prizes at the World Master Open. Among his many distinctions are numerous Gold, Silver, and special honors awarded by esteemed competitions throughout Europe, Russia, and the United States.</p>
            
            <p>He was further distinguished by the Médaille de Platine of the prestigious French Société Académique Arts, Sciences et Lettres — the highest distinction conferred by the society, bestowed at the summit of its distinctions in recognition of an exceptional contribution to art, science, and letters, this honor reflects his rare synthesis of these fields, reuniting disciplines too often separated and shaping a singular contribution to contemporary thought and creation.</p>
  
            <p>In 2025, he was awarded the Absolute First Platinum Prize at the European Symphony Architect Awards for his opus and album <em>Dichotomie</em>. Further recognizing his artistic influence, the jury named him “Artist of the Month” at the European Classical Music Awards. These same awards later declared him the Annual Diamond Prize Winner and bestowed upon him the distinguished title of “Composer of the Year” at the 2024 Annual Grand Prix.</p>
  
            <p>His album <em>Regards sur l’Horizon</em>, honored by the Global Music Awards, has already established itself as a landmark in contemporary musical creation. <p>

            <p>In 2025, Sherif Dahroug was invited to join the Recording Academy / GRAMMYs® as a Voting Member, honoring his artistic vision and global impact on contemporary music.</p>

            </p>His academic journey, shaped by studies at the Schola Cantorum, the École Normale de Musique de Paris, and the Royal Academy of Music in London, placed him under the tutelage of eminent mentors—heirs to the great pedagogical traditions of Sergiu Celibidache, Nadia Boulanger, and Olivier Messiaen—including Narcis Bonet, Jean-Pierre Wallez, Jean-Dominique Pasquet, Michel Denis, Pascal Boëls, Éric Franceries, and many others.</p>

          </div>
          <!-- Column 2 -->
          <div>
            <p>Decorated with the highest artistic honors, academic distinctions, and performance awards, he holds a Doctorate in Musical Arts (DMA) in Performance, a Master of Music in Composition and Musicology, and a Master of Arts (HEM) in Chamber Music. A distinguished laureate of the Prix de Virtuosité, he was further honored with the unanimously awarded Diplôme de Concert—the highest artistic distinction conferred by the Schola Cantorum, representing the absolute summit of musical excellence within the elite French academic tradition.<p></p>

            </p>Beyond music, Sherif Dahroug is a philosopher and author whose literary work continues to expand the boundaries of artistic creation.</p>

            <p>His book, <em>Dichotomie: Grand Hymne des Deux Terres</em>, stands as a bold and singular masterpiece, fusing poetry, philosophy, and mysticism to offer a uniquely immersive experience. More than just an exploration of ancient Egyptian thought, this work revives it through an incantatory language, a labyrinthine structure, and a contemplative aesthetic, elevating duality as a foundational principle of both art and existence.</p>
  
            <p>His earlier book, <em>In Pursuit of a Sonic Architectonics</em>, serves as a bold manifesto that transcends traditional boundaries of creation. Drawing from the rich symbolism and philosophy of ancient Egypt, it bridges transcendental contemplation with technical realization, transforming contradictions and dissonances into spaces of unprecedented beauty.</p>
  
            <p>An insatiable explorer of the correspondences between sound, space, and transcendence, Sherif Dahroug pursues a vision where each creation becomes a timeless sonic architecture, a sanctuary open to infinity.</p>
  
            <p>His most recent book, <em>Hathor, Iyri — À l’aube du Vin de Lumière</em>, inaugurates a new philosophical and literary form conceived by the author — the <em>Hiérodrame Tragique – Poème Mystère</em>. Rooted in the great Greco-Egyptian traditions, this genre unites myth, ritual, and philosophy into a sacred dramaturgy where the act of creation becomes a passage between art, thought, and the divine.</p>
  
            <p><strong>Lyre de Mercure — Éditions, Musique, Arts &amp; Innovation</strong></p>
  
            <p>Sherif Dahroug is the founder and director of <em>Lyre de Mercure — Éditions, Musique, Arts &amp; Innovation</em> (est. 2011), an independent artistic and editorial house dedicated to the cultivation, production, and transmission of works of high artistic and intellectual value.</p>
  
            <p>Through music production, editorial work, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the realization of projects integrating sound, text, image, and space, Lyre de Mercure affirms a commitment to works conceived for transmission — creations designed to endure, to be inhabited, and to contribute meaningfully to contemporary culture.</p>

            Beyond performance and composition, Sherif Dahroug embraces a vision where music intertwines with philosophy, visual arts, architecture, and astronomy. By transcending traditional boundaries, he crafts a language that speaks to the soul as much as to the intellect.
          </p>
          <p>
            His musical universe spans neo‑impressionism to innovative theatrical soundscapes. Recent works (2023–2024) such as <em>Philae</em>, <em>Hiérakonpolis</em>, <em>Abydos</em>, <em>ATUM</em>, and <em>Eirene – Old Comedy!</em> exemplify his versatility.
          </p>
          <p>
            These compositions reveal a mastery of technique and artistic sensitivity that pushes the boundaries of contemporary music, inviting contemplation of the interconnectedness between disciplines, humanity, and the cosmos.

            Deeply inspired by ancient Egypt, Sherif Dahroug delves into its astronomy, philosophy, and hieroglyphic writing. Since 2016, his blog <em>Meditations on Egyptian Wisdom</em> has cultivated a community drawn to his perspective.

            Drawing from the astronomy, history, and philosophy of this civilization, he infuses his musical creations with a timeless and universal dimension.
